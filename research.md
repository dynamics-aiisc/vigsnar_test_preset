The focus of my current research is on the areas of dynamical systems and networks, data science and learning theory, and computational neuroscience. My past and current projects revolve around problems that emerge in the context of dynamical systems and the data generated by them. I am interested in modeling and learning dynamical mechanisms from data, analyzing and controlling the behavior of dynamic populations, and deploying the techniques developed to emerging physical, biological, and medical applications. In my research, I strive to address such problems by developing theoretical and algorithmic frameworks that are reliable, tractable, and secure. In addition, I am also interested in developing mathematically-grounded computational and learning tools that are efficient, interpretable, and scalable. <!--Our interests lead to an interdisciplinary research program across boundaries of science and engineering.My past and current research efforts are concerned with problems emerging in the context of networked dynamical systems and the data generated by them. I am particularly interested in tackling commonly encountered and critical tasks, e.g., analysis, learning, and control design, that arise in the context of large-scale dynamical systems and complex networks in emerging applications across engineering, physical, and biological domains. -->
